# Overview
A lane detection algorithm is proposed as part of the perception component for a self driving vehicle. By using a video feed input of a car driving on the highway, the algorithm will detect where the lanes are so that the car can use itâ€™s location to avoid getting out of the lane. It will also be able to predict any turn on the road to secure a good tracking of the lane.
